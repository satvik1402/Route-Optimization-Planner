## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Navigate to project directory**
   ```bash
   cd c:/Users/satvi/Desktop/project
   ```

2. **Start the Streamlit app (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Local: http://localhost:8501
   - If it doesn’t open automatically, copy the URL from the terminal and paste it in your browser.

4. **Stop the server**
   - Press Ctrl + C in the terminal

#### Alternative command
If Streamlit is on your PATH, this also works:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

#### Troubleshooting
- If you see "streamlit is not recognized": use the recommended command `python -m streamlit run app.py`.
- If port 8501 is busy, Streamlit will automatically try 8502, 8503, etc.

3. **Access the application**
   - The app will automatically open in your default browser
   - If not, navigate to: `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the Application

#### 1. Filter Routes
- Use sidebar filters to narrow down routes
- Select route type, origin, destination, and weather conditions
- Adjust distance range slider
- View filtered results count in real-time

#### 2. Choose Optimization Priority

- View top 5 optimized routes based on your selection
- Read AI-generated insights and recommendations

#### 3. Explore Visualizations
- Navigate through 4 tabs: Overview, Route Analysis, Performance, Comparison
- Interact with charts (zoom, pan, hover for details)
- Use comparison tool to analyze multiple routes side-by-side

#### 4. Analyze Data
- Sort detailed data table by any metric
- Use color-coded efficiency scores
- Identify patterns and outliers

#### 5. Export Results

## Data Analysis

### Dataset Overview
- **Total Routes**: 150 orders
- **Domestic Routes**: Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad
- **International Routes**: Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok
- **Metrics Tracked**: Distance, fuel consumption, toll charges, traffic delays, weather impact

### Derived Metrics
The application calculates several derived metrics:

1. **Fuel Cost** = Fuel Consumption (L) × ₹102/L
2. **Total Cost** = Fuel Cost + Toll Charges
3. **CO₂ Emissions** = Fuel Consumption (L) × 2.68 kg/L
4. **Total Time** = (Distance / 60 km/h) + (Traffic Delay / 60)
5. **Efficiency Score** = Custom algorithm (0-100%)
